  <p>Dear Eileen,</p >
  <p>
      Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.

  <h2>Starting dates</h2>
  <p>
      We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:

  <ul>
      <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
      <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
      <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-03-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
